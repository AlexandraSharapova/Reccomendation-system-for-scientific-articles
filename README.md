# Recommendation-system-for-scientific-articles
Choosing the most appropriate venue for scientific paper publication is getting more challenging nowadays due to the significant upward trend in the number of journals. Various factors should be considered, such as topic accordance, venue ranking, and publication probability, to successfully finish the way from submission to acceptance. The selection problem is exacerbated through the continuous emergence of additional venues, which can lead to an incorrect request with wasting the time, effort, and money of a creator.

Although, recommendation systems can support authors in this tedious process by suggesting articles to journals with a high probability of acceptance and a citation rate where the publication can significantly contribute to the author's h-index. Our approach includes not only early published open-source data, but also a new manually collected corpus of scholarly documents consisting of detailed information about papers and venues with the most critical data â€“ their abstracts. In this work, we implement our dataset for venue recommendation models, such as SciBert and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which drive papers to increase future interest and choose the most appropriate resources for publishing based on the results. Moreover, we developed the dataset for the classification task and tried to predict the number of citations over 10 years after publication relying on user input.
